# Setup Jupyter Notebook for R

## Overview

R is an interpreted programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/). It is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. 

R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundationâ€™s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and macOS.

Refinitiv's APIs, such as Eikon Data API, Datastream Web Service, DataScope Select, RTH, and Refinitiv Data Platform also support R. In this article, we will explain steps to:
- Install R
- Install Jupyter Notebook for R
- Install Refinitiv's APIs for R, such as Eikon Data API, and Datastream Web Service
- Install [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) which is R Open Source Graphing Library

Moreover, in the end, there is a link to R examples that demonstrate how to use Refinitiv's APIs with Jupyter Notebook.
